This is Student Robotics CyanIDE.

It is a web-based IDE for developing code for Student Robotics robots.

A guide for getting it running will be found here (once we've got it working properly):
https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/wiki/CyanIDE

In the mean time here's some basic info about the make targets:

`applet`: Builds the java applet used for checkouts.
          READ applet/README first!

`dev`: Sets up the base folders you'll need for the repos etc.

`docs`: Builds the docs according to the doxyfile.
        Currently this means html docs in html/ and latex docs in latex/

`clean`: Removes both of the above.

You can run tests on CyanIDE by running `./run-tests`.

Dependancies:
 * PHP 5.3
 * ant     # for building the Java applet
 * javac   # for building the Java applet
 * doxygen # for building the docs.
 * PHP CLI # for running the tests.

You have to build the applet to get things working and for God's sake read the README in applet/
