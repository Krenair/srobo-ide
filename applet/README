This is the CyanIDE file saving applet.

It searches drives on the users machine for a drive with a .srobo file
in the root, and puts the zip file there.

To set up a testing keystore do the following:

Using make (from the CyanIDE root):
	make applet/.keystore

Manually:
	keytool -genkeypair -keyalg rsa -alias test-only-applet-key
 ** Set the keystore password to testpass or change build.xml **

DONT USE A TESTING KEY IN PRODUCTION
